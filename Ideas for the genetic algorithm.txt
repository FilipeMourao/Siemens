We defined a class "Room" with the following attributes:
a width and a length 
a number of rectangles and circles 

We defined a class rectangle with  
coordinate vector (x,y)
width and  length

We defined a class circles with
coordinate vector (x,y)
radius

First generation:
Random generates the coordinates for each shape;

Evaluation:
Calculate the distance between every 2 shapes

Crossing over:
Swipe coordinates between 2 shapes 

Distance between tables should be a minimum of 60cm and 90cm for
